>Autor: Adrian Jelonek |  E-mail: ajelonek(at)gmail.com

## Project is still under construction
### The whole idea:
1. First of all you will have to register,
2. Then you will be able to add your recent expense (e.g. groceries receipt) via simple form,
3. Of course you will be able to add expenses on everyday basis,
4. Your expenses will be stored in a application database,
5. Application will summarize your expenses, helping you to indicate expenses types which should be changed in future,
6. At the end dashboard will help you embrace costs of everyday life.

### Current technologies behind:
Project is powered by WordPress. WP is mainly used for user registration process. No default themes or WP plugins are used in this project.

- PHP OOP is based on simplified Active Directory pattern.
- CanvasJS framework is used for dashboard purposes.


You can search for code samples in wp-content/themes/Basic:
- Class directory - simple CRUD,
- functions.php file - operations on forms,
- page-formularz-wydatkow.php file - we add expenses here,
- page-zestawienie-wydatkow.php file - we search for expenses here.


### Technologies to be used ASAP:
CSS based on SASS + GULP - fully styled Basic theme (wp-content/themes/Basic),
