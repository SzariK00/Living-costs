## Project is still under construction
It will work like this:
1. First of all you will have to register,
2. Then you will be able to add your recent expense (e.g. groceries receipt) via simple form,
3. Of course you will be able to add expenses on everyday basis,
5. Your expenses will be stored in application database (MySQL),
6. Application will summarize your expenses, helping you to indicate expenses types which should be reduced in future.

Project is powered by WordPress + **OOP mechanics based on Active Directory pattern.**
